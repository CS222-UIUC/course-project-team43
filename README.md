# QuickShare
QuickShare is a file-sharing platform that offers an intuitive and secure way to share files with others. With QuickShare, you can:

    * **Share files anonymously**: QuickShare does not require you to create an account, so you can share files without revealing your identity.
    * **Share files securely with checksum verification**: QuickShare uses SHA256 checksum verification to ensure that the files you share are not tampered with during transmission.
    * **Control the duration of time a file remains in the system**: QuickShare allows you to set an expiration time for each file you share, so you can ensure that your files are only available for as long as you want.
    * **Share files with no overhead**: QuickShare is designed to be lightweight and efficient, so you can share files without worrying about bloated software or complicated user interfaces.
    * **Upload large files that other services will not**: QuickShare has been optimized to handle large files with ease, so you can share files that might be too big for other services to handle.
